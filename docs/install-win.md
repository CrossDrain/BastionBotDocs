# Bastion Installation on Windows

!!! tip "Want to run Bastion 24x7?"
    If you want Bastion to serve 24/7 without having to hosting it on your
    PC and want to keep it cheap, reliable and convenient as possible, you can
    install Bastion, using the following guide, on a [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/0ee6cb9c7ee0)
    Linux VPS using [this link](https://m.do.co/c/0ee6cb9c7ee0) (using this link
    will be supporting The Bastion Bot project and will give you **$10** for
    free to start with DigitalOcean).

## Download the installer

[Right Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBastionBot/Bastion-Scripts/master/BastionInstaller.cmd)
and Click **Save Link As...** and Save the file as `BastionInstaller.cmd`
(Bastion Installer for Windows).

## Proceed with the installation

Now that you've downloaded the installer, it will automatically download and
install everything you'll need to run Bastion.

To start the installation, **Right-Click** the downloaded file and Click
**Run as Administrator**.

Wait for a few moments for the installer to finish installing.

After the installation is done, it will prompt you to configure Bastion and will
ask you to configure Bastion, type/paste the answers as asked (here you'll be
needing your API keys) and if you want to skip any step, just leave it blank and
press <kbd>&crarr; Enter</kbd>.

After you're done configuring Bastion, it'll let you know that the installation
was successfully completed and Bastion is ready to boot up. :smile:

Now, you should have a new folder named `Bastion` in your Windows Desktop.

## Get Bastion running

You get a `run.cmd` script file that makes it easy to run Bastion without
any hassle. To start Bastion, **Double-Click** the `run.cmd` file.

Now, you will see the status of Bastion in a Command Prompt (CMD) window.
If you want to terminate & stop Bastion, just close the Command Prompt window.
